# Bazookas Twitter Test

Test made during 1 week for Bazookas to see where my skills were in regards to Android & programming in general.
This is the first ever Android app I made and I had a lot of fun working on it, designing it was tedious at times though.

Thanks to my collegues at Bazookas for their guidance and tips given during development.

# What I Learned

* Working with Android
* Basics of Android app development
* Gradle basics
